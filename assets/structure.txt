The structure is quite simple enough, but it is flexible and can be developed in the future.

                CParser                         CStorage ( will store CImages )
    ( a base class for all parsers )
                /    \           \              CImage ( a class which store useful data from images)
               /      \           \
     CParserPNG      CParserJPEG  (other formats in the future)
       *all parsers will return an instance of CImage*
